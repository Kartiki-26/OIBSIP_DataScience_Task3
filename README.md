# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of a used car based on various features such as year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and ownership details.

## Steps Performed
1. Downloaded and loaded the used car price dataset.
2. Performed basic data exploration to understand the dataset structure.
3. Removed unnecessary columns such as car name.
4. Encoded categorical variables like fuel type, selling type, and transmission.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
7. Evaluated the model using regression metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- Kaggle Dataset (Used Car Price Prediction)

## Outcome
A machine learning regression model was successfully developed to predict the selling price of used cars. The model demonstrated reasonable accuracy and helped in understanding the complete workflow of a machine learning project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
